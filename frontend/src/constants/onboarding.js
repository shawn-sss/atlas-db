# Welcome to Atlas DB

Atlas DB keeps your knowledge, action items, and onboarding paths in one workspace so teammates can orient themselves quickly.

## What this workspace gives you

- Collections and folders: organize work by team, project, or process so people can browse by intent.
- Documents: craft how-tos, handoffs, and checklists with a single focus and clear expectations.
- Metadata & publishing: use owners, tags, and statuses to signal who owns a doc and whether it is ready for teammates.
- Views & discovery: filtered lists, search, backlinks, and table views help you find the right content fast.
- Linking & collaboration: share internal links, mention teammates, and follow related work for context.
- Versioning & history: every change is traced so you can review updates or roll back as needed.
- Backups & safety: periodic snapshots give you confidence you can restore a document if something goes sideways.

## Getting started (quick)

- Open one of the starter guides below to understand how your team uses Atlas DB today.
- Create a focused page with **New**, pick a descriptive title, then link it to related pages so others can discover the context.
- Pin the handbook, troubleshooting guide, or another reliable doc as the Start page so teammates land on the best instructions.

## Starter content

- **Important Links** – the hub for dashboards, catalogues, and shared policies you reference before editing downstream docs.
- **New PC Setup** – describe the machine class, imaging expectations, and who covers each handoff step.
- **Software Installs** – capture the repeatable installers we run after imaging, with verification guidance for each version.

Keep pages concise, link liberally, and surface metadata (owner/status) so teammates always know what to trust.`;
